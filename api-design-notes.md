1. List the semantic descriptors
- a game
- a list of games
- players in a game
- rounds in a game
- tricks in a round
- cards in a trick
- cards in a hand
- ranks of a card
- suits of a card
- bids in a round
- nums of a trick

2. Draw a state diagram
- what can you do?
- how do you move from state to state?
- here we are trying to describe a space, and we're also creating some dependencies
- don't yet talk about *how*

3. Reconcile names
- IANA Link Relation Values
- schema.org
- microformats
- dublin core
- activity streams
* so take the vocab from step 1 and see if you can reconcile them with something from above ^^

4. Choose a Media Type
Collection+JSON ???
